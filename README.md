## pointers
Describes fastest way to pass data across two variables

## syncData
Recommends ways to synchronise data read and write across distributed storage system

## consistent-hashing
Implementation of consistent hashing as described in syncData
To test implementation run ```python consistent-hashing/consistent-hashing.py```
It will simulate creating servers, populating data and scale up/ scale down events
